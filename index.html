    <H3>History of Computers</H3>

    <p>One of the earliest machines designed to assist people in calculations was the <b>abacus</b> which is still being used some 5000 years after its invention.</p>

    <p>In 1642 Blaise Pascal (a famous French mathematician) invented an adding machine based on mechanical gears in which numbers were represented by the cogs on the wheels.</p>

    <p>Englishman, Charles Babbage, invented in the 1830's a "Difference Engine" made out of brass and pewter rods and gears, and also designed a further device which he called an "Analytical Engine". His design contained the five key characteristics of modern computers:-</p>

    <ol>
        <li>An input device</li>
        <li>Storage for numbers waiting to be processed</li>
        <li>A processor or number calculator</li>
        <li>A unit to control the task and the sequence of its calculations</li>
        <li>An output device</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Augusta Ada Byron (later Countess of Lovelace) was an associate of Babbage who has become known as the first computer programmer.</p>

   <h3>Computer Parts</h3>

   <h4>Central Processing Unit</h4>

   <p>A <b>central processing unit(CPU)</b> is the electronic circuitrywithin acomputer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output(l/0) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 19605.<sup>[1]</sup></p>

   <h4>Keyboard</h4>

    <p>A computer keyboard is a typewriter-style device which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches. Following the decline of punch cards and paper tape, interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards became the main input method for computers. Keyboard keys (buttons) typically have characters engraved or printed on them,[2] and each press Seeke yeally ones onds a singe een mod However, pre doing eter, nur eas require resters herines or / simultaneous key presses can produce actions or execute computer commands. In normal usage, the keyboard is used as a text entry interface for typing text and numbers into a word processor, text editor or any other program. In a modern computer, the interpretation of key presses is generally left to the software. A computer keyboard distinguishes each physical key from every other key and reports all key presses to the controlling software.
